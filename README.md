+ Project summary:
    + Dataset: McGill Billboard Project http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/billboard  
    + Objective: Generate characteristic chord progressions using sequence analysis
    + EDA
        + Genre popularity over time 
        + Major chords across genres
    + Naive Bayes: 
        + Predict genres using chord frequencies
        + Baseline model: simulation of genres using stratified probability
    + Sequence analysis on chord progression
        + n-gram: bigram, 4-gram
        + tf-idf
        + Objective: generate chord sequence with 4-grams
    + Visualizations
        + Use bigrams to make chord diagrams
        + Use 4-grams to make sankey diagrams
    + Shiny app: MelodySoup
        + Generate a sequence of chords given a particular genre (do demo with audio)
